# Starter Theme

This is a starter theme that builds on top of the [GeneratePress Child Theme by Addison Hall](https://github.com/addisonhall/generatepress-child "GitHub Link"). By integrating well-thought-out custom fields, I've created a content management system that, at it's core, can build most designs. As more websites are built using this theme I will continue to update it to ensure that it can integrate any layout.

## Changelog

I use to have a dope changelog that I maintained in the early days of developing this. You can find those in the /changelogs folder. Note though that those changelogs are very old and a lot has changed since then. If I can figure out how to push the old version of a theme that I have saved to this repository I will as a different branch so the comparisons can be made. Actually I might just try to do that right now. That sounds fun.

## Core Concepts

1. Reusability and Scalability
2. Layered Content Generation
3. Add-On Library
4. Minimize Duplicate CSS

I'll add more once I try getting the old version of this theme into a different branch.
